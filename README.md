# Ride Sharing Project

As a part of Statistical Inference for Data Science I (CAP5300) for New College of Florida's Master's of Data Science program, we were required to choose a dataset, and conduct statistical analysis to find associations between variables

## Dataset

The data comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices), and was collected via Uber and Lyft api queries and corresponding weather conditions during a few weeks in November-December in 2018 by this [user](https://github.com/ravi72munde).

## Results

Our final results can be viewed [here](https://natewagner10.github.io/Ride-Sharing-Project/stats_project.html).


## Attribution

Inspiration for cleaning and combining the rides and weather table came from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tangyx233/uber-lyft-cab-prices).
